    "Although number of tweets is a good indicator of each cloud vendor's popularity, there are some tweets that are much more visible than others. A tweet's visibility can be calculated using 3 key drivers: 1. The number of people following the user making the tweet, 2. The number of times that a tweet has been retweeted, 3. The number of people that have liked the tweet. The higher the number in each category, the higher will be the visibility of the tweet as well. Moreover, the weight that each of the 3 key drivers provide to a tweet's visibility is not the same, since a tweet with 100 likes will have received a much higher visibility than a tweet made by a tweetor with 100 followers, since in order to receive 100 likes it means that the tweet has been viewed by much more than 100 people. Furthermore, a tweet with 100 retweets will have received a much higher visibility than a tweet with 100 likes, since a user is more prone to like a tweet than retweet it to his network. Although subjective we are going to assign a visibility weight of 0.6 per retweet, a weight of 0.3 per like and finally a weight of 0.1 per number of followers."
